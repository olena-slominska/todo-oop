## The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible

### Features:
* View the optimal layout for the app depending on User's device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Add new todos to the list
* Mark todos as complete
* Delete todos from the list
* Filter by all/active/complete todos
* Clear all completed todos
* Toggle light and dark mode
* Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

Code structure was taken from Tania Rascia's Todo OOP tutorial https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/ .
